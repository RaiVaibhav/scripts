### A bunch of scripts

This repo is a collection of scripts we use at coala.

#### I want to add a new script

 - Create a directory at the root of this repo to store your script's files. Name it something self-explanatory, but don't make it too long. Something like `get-inactive-issues` would be an example of a good name.

 - Create a `README.md` in that directory explaining how your script should be run.

 - **Important:** Make sure you don't have any files with sensitive information. This includes API tokens, passwords, and anything else. Preferably, store your credentials in a separate file and make sure to add that file to this repo's `.gitignore` to ensure you don't commit it by mistake.
